## The Original Game
This was originally any entry into Score Space #9 Game Jam (https://itch.io/jam/scorejam9/rate/707737)

## The Game
C.W.I.S is a tactical survival game where you fend off endless waves of missiles heading right for you. How do you stop these missiles? with a C.W.I.S of course! Your ship has two of these, one at the bow and another at the stern. While these can shoot missiles out of the sky with ease, they have limited ammo and can easily overheat. As you play you can shoot supply crates to get ammo and rank up your weapons over time when they make successful kills.

This game was made as an entry into the Score Space #9 Game Jam with the theme of Climbing. Now I can already guess that some people may struggle to see how this links to the jam theme of Climbing! Well, I took climbing as "climbing through the ranks", as if you were going through the rank to earn a command, but instead of a command your ship got better the longer it lasted. a rather abstract taking of the theme I will admit, but we like being different and not following the traditional through train.
